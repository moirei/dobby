# Dobby

Dobby is a GraphQL query builder and CRUD client that makes working with graphql data sources and object models enjoyable. It's designed [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [Laravel Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-php.com/) backends in mind.

All things considered, Dobby provides a powerful abstraction for consuming GraphQL APIs.

## Installation
